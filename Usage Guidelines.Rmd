## FIRST RUN THE COURSE PROJECT1.R File
This file contains the code to read the data, clean the data as needed

## NEXT, RUN the CREATEPLOT.R File
This has some helper functions, basically putting a wrapper around some of the base functions to  just use what I needed.

## NEXT, You can run each of the Plot R files in any order.
These have the plots created individually as well as by callign the helper functions.  Personally, i liked creating the helper functions and it made it less clutter.
